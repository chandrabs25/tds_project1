I used github api to search for users in mumbai with a minimum of 50 followers and then retrived the details of the identified users and their repositries, while using xratelimit to stay under request limit.

The most suprising observation i found in the analysis is the follower count is negatively correlated to the length of the bio, which means usually users follow the people that are experts in a certain program rather than people who try to work with many languages

Instead of trying many languages, try to focus on a particular language and get better at it as being an expert in a one or two languages to better than not being good in any language
