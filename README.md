I used github api to search for users in mumbai with a minimum of 50 followers and then retrived the details of the users and their repositries.

The most suprising observation i found in the analysis is the follower count is negatively correlated to the length of the bio, which means usually users follow the people that are experts in certain field than otherwise.

Instead of trying many languages, try to focus on a particular language and get better at it.
